This mini-project won't be submitted for review, but it'll give you a head start on the first part of the project for this module.\n",

    "<p>The Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach textbook provides psuedocode for the minimax algorithm that defines a pair of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_recursion\">mutually recursive</a> helper functions that traverse the min and max levels of the game tree to find the value of each branch, and a decision function called from the root node that chooses the optimal move from the root of the game tree based on the value of each branch.  The two helper functions are nearly identical except for the utility returned in terminal states, and the use of the max or min comparison function.</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is also common to see minimax presented as a simply <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Pseudocode\">recursive function</a> by treating the helper functions as conditional branches, or even (under certain assumptions) to eliminate separate cases for handling min and max levels altogether as in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax#Negamax_base_algorithm\">negamax</a>.  However, we will adhere to the version from the AIMA text in this exercise, because it separates the functionality for handling the min level and max level nodes (which makes it easier to test), and more clearly illustrates that you only need to choose a move from the root node -- all other children nodes only need to return a value.</p>"

    "<p>To code the minimax algorithm, first you'll implement a class to keep track of the game state for the mini-isolation game from Thad's quiz. The game state object will handle all of the rules of the game, and include all of the information describing the specific configuration of the game at a particular point in time. At a minimum, the board state needs to keep track of which cells are open and closed; which player has initiative (whose turn it is to move); and where each player is on the board. (<em>Note: Remember to block off the lower right corner when you create a new board!</em>)  Your class only needs to define two methods: <code>forecast_move()</code> and <code>get_legal_moves()</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>We will attach a coordinate frame to the board in the top left corner and set the x axis to move from left to right and the y axis to move from top to bottom. Each cell on the board can be described by an ordered pair <code>(x, y)</code>. Thus (0, 0) is the top-left corner; (2, 1) is the bottom right corner (the blocked cell).</p>\n",
    "<p>The <code>forecast_move()</code> method will take a move (a pair of coordinates <code>(x, y)</code> of the desired endpoint of the player) and return a <strong>new</strong> game state object (you should not mutate game state objects). Treating the game state as immutable makes it trivial to roll out and unwind each branch of the game tree (children nodes will simply be garbage collected when the caller returns). (<em>Hint:</em> check out the <code>copy.deepcopy</code> module from the standard library to copy your board state.)</p>\n",
    "<p>The <code>get_legal_moves()</code> method takes no arguments and returns a <code>list</code> (the tests will fail for any other type of collection) of moves available to the active player in the current state. The \"active\" player is the agent with initiative to move (e.g., on an empty board player 1 is the active player). According to the game rules, each player can move to any open square for their first move, and then to any open square along a row, column, or diagonal from their current position. (Note that players cannot jump or pass through blocked squares.)</p>"

    "<p>You will implement the minimax algorithm in two parts, by first implementing helper functions (a terminal state test, min-value, and max-value), then implementing the decision function. Notice that the <code>min-value</code> and <code>max-value</code> functions only need to return a single value representing a score; the function for selecting a move will come later.</p>\n",
    "<p>We will also make two simplifying assumptions in order to adhere to the conventions of Thad's quizzes:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Assumption 1: a state is terminal if the active player has no remaining moves</li>\n",
    "<li>Assumption 2: the board utility is -1 if it terminates at a max level, and +1 if it terminates at a min level</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>The first assumption is only required in order to allow the second assumption. In general, we can determine that a game is terminal if <em>either</em> player has no remaining moves, but that would require terminal nodes at both min and max levels to support returning +1 or -1 depending on which player is the winner.  Restricting the terminal condition to the active player means that there is only one possible return value at min or max nodes.</p>\n",
    "<p>The second assumption is specified in the lecture quizzes. Technically, any pair of values can be used to indicate wins and losses so long as they admit an ordering such that the score for winning is greater than the score for losing; e.g., instead of -1 &amp; +1 you could you use -π &amp; π/2, or 100.99 &amp; 101.0, or -∞ &amp; +∞. It is common to use -∞ &amp; +∞ when a heuristic function is used (which we'll do in another project for this module) because it ensures that the heuristic value never exceeds the range of wins or losses.</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Notice that the value does not depend on which player is \"active\" on the board. A win for the searching player (the player that initiated the search from the root of the game tree) is always worth +1 and a loss is always worth -1. One <em>very</em> common mistake is to \"flip\" the utility between min and max nodes, but the score should be relative to the desirability of the outcome for the searching player.</p>\n",
    "<p>Now complete the helper functions in the quiz below.</p>"
